<h1>Step 1: Attach Grip tape to Deck</h1>    
    <ul>
    <li>Place your deck on a flat surface so the nose and tail ends are facing up and the graphic on the bottom of the deck is facing down.</li>
    <li>Peel off the grip tape backing and place the grip tape on the deck. Press down so it lays flat.</li>
    <li>Run a screwdriver or file along the edges of the board to trace an outline of the deck. This will serve as a guide when you’re ready to cut.</li>
    <li>Hold a razor at 45 degrees, make a small incision, and trim the excess grip tape, following the outline of the deck.</li>
    <li>Sand down the edges of the grip tape to smooth any rough or lifted portions that could peel up.</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Step 2: Mount Tucks to Deck</h1>    
    <ul>
    <li>Locate the mounting holes, then use the bolts or a screwdriver to punch holes downward through the grip tape. Place bolts through the holes in the deck. If you’re installing risers, start by fitting those onto the bolts. If not, slip the baseplate onto the bolts.</li>
    <li>Hold the hardware in place while you attach one truck at a time. Make sure your two trucks are facing each other—IE, both kingpins are facing in.</li>  
    <li>Fasten the nuts over the trucks using your skate tool or socket wrench. Use a skate tool to tighten the heads of the bolts in an “X” pattern. Repeat on the other side.</li>  
    </ul>
    <h1>Step 3: Install Wheel Bearings and Attach Wheel to Trucks</h1>    
    <ul>
    <li>Remove axle nuts and speed washers. Place bearing on the axle and press the wheel over the bearing until you feel the bearing slide into the center of the wheel. Then insert the bearing spacer inside the wheel from the opposite side. If you hear a popping sound when you press the wheel onto the bearing it means the bearing is fully in. Do this for all four wheels.</li>
    <li>Place one speed washer on the axle of the skateboard truck. If you’re using a spacer, put it on the axle next. If not, install the wheel onto the axle, followed by the second washer.</li>  
    <li>With your skate tool or wrench, fasten the nut until there is no play—the wheel should be able to spin freely. Make sure your wheel is level—if it lays at an angle, it means your bearings aren’t fully in.</li>  
    </ul>
