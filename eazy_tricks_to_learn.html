<h1>Ollie</h1>
<p>Both flip tricks and grinds utilize the ollie. Ollies allow the skater to jump off the ground. The motion of the ollie requires the skater to push down on the concave area at the rear of the board (the tail) with his back foot. He then jumps into the air after the tail of the board hits the ground. The skater uses the front foot to level out by sliding it towards the front of the board. Landing solidly on all four wheels completes the ollie.</p>    
<h1>Kickflip and Heelflip</h1>
<p>Skaters use the front foot to perform the kickflip and heelflip. Shortly after popping an ollie with your back foot, use the toes of your front foot to kick the inside edge of the board. Wait for the board to flip completely before landing back on top of the deck. For the heelflip, kick the outside edge of the board to flip it in the opposite direction of the kickflip.</p> 
<h1>Frontside and Backside Pop-Shove It</h1>
<p>During the frontside and backside pop-shove it, the board performs a rotation as opposed to a flip. After popping an ollie, the skater kicks the front foot forward and the back foot backwards. The regular-footed stance (riding with the left foot up front) spins the frontside pop-shove it in a clockwise rotation. Skaters perform the backside pop-shove it by kicking the front foot backwards and the back foot forwards. The backside pop-shove it spins counterclockwise for the regular footers.</p>   
<h1>Varial Kickflip and Heelflip</h1>
<p>The varial kickflip combines the kickflip and the backside pop-shove it. The regular-footed skater allows the board to flip and spin 180 degrees clockwise before landing. The varial heelflip combines the front-side pop-shove it and the heelflip. A regular-footed skater picks up both feet to allow the board to flip and turn 180 degrees counterclockwise prior to landing.</p>    
<h1>Grinds</h1>
<p>To do a 50-50 grind, approach a rail or ledge and pop an ollie, landing with both trucks on the edge of the rail or ledge. The trucks will slide across the surface as you balance on top of the board. Pop an ollie when nearing the end of the rail to land the grind. The 5-0 grind consists of the same motions as the 50-50, except you only grind on the back truck. Grind on only the front truck of the board to perform a nosegrind.</p>
